## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Be specific** - "Compare top 5 protocols" works better than "show me protocols"
2. **Use action words** - "Chart X" or "Visualize Y"
3. **Check debug info** - Click "Debug Info" to see the raw data
4. **Works with any data** - As long as your backend has the data, charts will appear!

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

### For Local Testing:
✅ Already set up! Just ask questions.

### For Production:
1. Deploy backend with chart generator:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   vercel --prod
   ```

2. Backend automatically includes chart support in streaming responses

3. Test on production!
