## 🚨 Common Issues

### "Redirect URI mismatch"
**Solution**: Make sure you added this EXACT URL to Google:
```
https://agfqlrbtlkzrpcmelwao.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback
```
(No trailing slash, must be `https://`)

### "Access blocked"
**Solution**: 
1. Make sure OAuth consent screen is configured
2. Add your email to "Test users" if app is in Testing mode

### "Invalid client"
**Solution**: Double-check Client ID/Secret in Supabase (no extra spaces)
